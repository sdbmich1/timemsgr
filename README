# KITS Koncierge application

Timemsgr is the rails web application for version 2 of Koncierge, a mobile intelligent message delivery platform 
that helps organizations increase engagement, reduce scheduling hassles, and increase revenues 
by delivering timely, relevant scheduling opportunities in Twitter-like fashion to usersâ€™ schedules.  Version 1
was built on top of MS stack using ASP.Net.

The application manages both the mobile and web presentations of the application by detecting the MIME types
dynamically and directing the user to the appropriate view files.  Mobile partial views are hosted in the app/views/mobile
folder while the web partial views are hosted in the app/views/shared folder.

JQuery Mobile is used by the application to manage and process the mobile user view requests.
